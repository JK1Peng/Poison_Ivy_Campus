# MATLAB Poison Ivy Leaf Recognition

## Overview
This project is a MATLAB-based application that specializes in the recognition of poison ivy leaves through advanced image processing techniques. By identifying poison ivy leaves, users can avoid exposure and the adverse skin reactions they may cause.

## Features
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Utilizes MATLAB's powerful image processing toolbox for accurate leaf recognition.
- **Poison Ivy Detection**: If a poison ivy leaf is detected, the system provides an alert to the user.
- **Visualization**: Highlights the poison ivy leaf in the image for a clear view.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine, preferably with the Image Processing Toolbox.
- Familiarity with MATLAB's interface will be beneficial for navigating the application.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open MATLAB and set the working directory to where the project files are located.
2. Run the main script (usually named `PoisonIvyRecognition.m` or similar).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to upload an image and process it.
